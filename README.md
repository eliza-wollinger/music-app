This music web application has an elegant and intuitive interface, designed using Figma and built using the ReactJS framework.

With ReactJS, the application provides real-time music playback, smooth transitions between pages, and fast response times, all essential for a perfect and enjoyable user experience.

To create a visually appealing and consistent design across all pages and components, the application uses Tailwind, a CSS framework. The pre-built components and classes that Tailwind allows, made it easy for me to customize the layout, typography, and color palette of the application, resulting in a professional and polished appearance.

One of the main features of this application would be its integration with RapidAPI. This API offers a wide range of music-related information, such as metadata, information about artists, and music streaming services, which the application can leverage to provide users with a more personalized discovery experience.
