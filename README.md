This music web application has an elegant and intuitive interface, designed using Figma and built using the ReactJS framework.

With ReactJS, the application provides real-time music playback, smooth transitions between pages, and fast response times, all essential for a perfect and enjoyable user experience.

To create a visually appealing and consistent design across all pages and components, the application uses Tailwind, a CSS framework. The pre-built components and classes that Tailwind allows, made it easy for me to customize the layout, typography, and color palette of the application, resulting in a professional and polished appearance.

One of the main features of this application would be its integration with RapidAPI. This API offers a wide range of music-related information, such as metadata, information about artists, and music streaming services, which the application can leverage to provide users with a more personalized discovery experience.

## Project Concept and Design

The music web app design process started with a thorough search of the top music players on the market, including Spotify, Apple Music, and SoundCloud. This research helped identify strengths and weaknesses in terms of usability.

I then created low fidelity wireframes as starter examples. These wireframes focused on the user experience and functionality of the app, ensuring the interface was user-friendly and easy to navigate.

Using Figma I developed high fidelity prototypes that incorporated visual elements such as typography, color schemes and graphics.

I paid close attention to every aspect of the design process, from layout and functionality to color scheme and typography, to ensure a seamless and enjoyable user experience.

In addition to the design considerations mentioned above, I also considered the importance of light and dark modes in the application's design. Users have different preferences when it comes to the brightness of their screens, and the ability to switch between light and dark modes can greatly improve the user experience.

To achieve this, I carefully selected color schemes to ensure that the app's design elements were optimized for both light and dark modes. This included testing the color contrast, adjusting the text size and weight, and tweaking the graphics to ensure they look great in both modes.
